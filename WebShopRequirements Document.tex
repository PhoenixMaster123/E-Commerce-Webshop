\section{Project Overview}

Our e-commerce webshop has a focus on a simple and modern shopping experience. There are the essential shopping features implemented, such as searching for products, filtering by category and adding them to the cart, and we want to include some extras that improve the user experience, like the option to switch between light and dark mode. \\

The shop should work smoothly on both mobile devices and desktop computers, so users can shop on both devices. Also, we are planning to add user logins so people can sign up and log in.\\

Our main features will be things like category filtering and a search function, so users can quickly search and find what they’re looking for. The user is able to add products to the cart, update the quantities, and remove items. There will also be a checkout page. For better user experience, we will implement a switch where the user can choose between light and dark mode.\\

\textbf{Target Users:}
Our target groups are \emph{regular online shoppers}—people browsing on their laptops or smartphones—and \emph{store administrators} who manage catalog and user data.\\\\

\textbf{Application Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build a clean, user‑friendly webshop with a modern design.
	\item Make product search and category filtering fast and intuitive.
	\item Allow shoppers to create accounts and log in securely.
	\item Enable full shopping‑cart functionality: add, update, and delete items.
	\item Provide an \emph{admin panel} to create, update, and delete products and to manage (or remove) user accounts.
	\item Support both light mode and dark mode for better user comfort.
	\item Ensure a fully responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

\end{itemize}

	\section{User Roles and Interactions}
	This section explains the different types of users who interact with our e-commerce webshop, their permissions, and the actions they can typically perform.
	\subsection*{Administrator/Admin}
	The Administrator oversees the overall management of the webshop. This role has the highest level of access and can modify nearly every aspect of the site. \\ \\
	\textbf{Typical Actions and Expected Outcomes:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The admin can add, update, and remove products from the catalog, any changes are instantly visible to customers. For example, the admin might add a new product, such as  \textit{wireless headphones}, with a price of \textit{129.99\,€}.
		\item The admin can also manage user accounts – such as viewing user \\ information or deleting accounts if it's needed.
	\end{itemize}




	\subsection*{Customer (Registered User)}
	Customers are users who have registered an account on the webshop. They can explore products, place orders, and manage their personal details and order history. \\ \\
	\textbf{Typical Actions and Expected Outcomes:}
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Customers can browse all available products, read detailed descriptions, and check their prices.
    		\item They can also use the search bar or apply filters, such as by category to narrow down the results.
    		\item Add products to the shopping cart for quick purchase.
    		\item Can proceed to checkout, choose a payment method, and complete their order easily.
    		\item Update personal information, including name, email, and password.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can browse the products without logging in.
		\item Can register or Sign In.
		\item Can add products to the cart, but the cart will remain active only while they are on the website. Once they leave, everything will be removed. The users must have an account to purchase the products otherwise it will be not possible.

	\section{Non-Functional Requirements}  

Our E-Commerce WebShop is designed to offer a stable, secure, and user-friendly experience. The following non-functional requirements describe the quality standards we aim to follow throughout the development:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Usability:}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Intuitive Navigation:}  
        We want users to find their way around easily. That’s why we’re going for clear and consistent menus.

        \item \textbf{User-Friendly Design:}  
        The design will be clean and modern, with a focus on readability. We’ll stick to a consistent color scheme, readable fonts, and buttons that look and feel familiar, so users don’t have to think twice about how to interact with the site.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Responsiveness:}  
    It doesn't matter if users are shopping on a desktop, tablet, or phone, the webshop should feel natural to use. Everything should adapt cleanly to different screen sizes without breaking the layout.

    \item \textbf{Response Time:}  
    The system shall respond to 95\% of user requests within 2 seconds under normal load.

    \item \textbf{Maintainability:}  
    We’re keeping things modular and organized. Reusable components and a clean file structure will make it easier to make changes later or onboard new team members if needed.

    \item \textbf{Error Handling:}  
        When something goes wrong, we'll show helpful messages like “Item out of stock—try similar products” instead of confusing errors. If an API call fails, we’ll display fallback content and a “Retry” button where it makes sense.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology Assumptions}

To build a responsive, maintainable, and feature‑rich e‑commerce
application, we adopt a modern React‑based stack that balances developer
productivity, performance, and industry best practices.  
The key technologies are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{React + TypeScript} – modern SPA framework with compile‑time type safety
	\item \textbf{Vite} – fast dev server and lightweight production builds
	\item \textbf{Tailwind CSS 4.1} + \textit{react‑bootstrap} – utility‑first styling plus ready‑made, accessible components
	\item \textbf{MUI (Material UI) }and its @mui/icons‑material set for consistent, accessible design
	\item \textbf{Axios} over HTTPS REST‑JSON – promise‑based HTTP client
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Time Constraint:}  The project must be completed by the end of the semester.
		Because of the limited time, we'll focus on implementing the core features first. If there's
		still time left, we can start working on optional features.
		\item \textbf{Resource Constraint:} Small team size, limited development hours per week.
		\item \textbf{Technical Constraint:} The front-end of the application must be \\ developed using
		\textbf{React.js}, as per course guidelines. The back-end \\ technology stack choice is flexible.
		\item \textbf{Knowledge Constraint:} Team members are still in the learning phase for some
		technologies, which may impact the speed of implementation and require additional time for
		research and troubleshooting.
		\item \textbf{Open Questions:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Will we integrate a real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) or simulate payments
			for the purpose of the project?
			\item Should we implement a loyalty program where users can earn points for each purchase
			that can later be redeemed for discounts, exclusive offers, or early access to sales?
			\item Should we integrate an AI chatbot to guide users through the shopping process, offer
			product recommendations, or help with issues like order tracking, or should we rely on
			traditional customer service?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
