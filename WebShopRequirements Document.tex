\section{Project Overview Enrico}

Our e-commerce webshop has a focus on a simple and modern shopping experience. There are the essential shopping features implemented, such as searching for products, filtering by category and adding them to the cart, and we want to include some extras that improve the user experience, like the option to switch between light and dark mode.

The shop should work smoothly on both mobile devices and desktop computers, so users can shop on both devices. Also, we are planning to add user logins so people can sign up and log in.

Our main features will be things like category filtering and a search function, so users can quickly search and find what they’re looking for. The user is able to add products to the cart, update the quantities, and remove items. There will also be a checkout page. For better user experience, we will implement a switch where the user can choose between light and dark mode.

\textbf{Target Users: }  
Our target group are normal online shoppers. This includes people browsing on their laptops or using their SmartPhones.

\textbf{Application Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build a clean and user-friendly webshop with modern design.
	\item Make product search and category filtering fast and intuitive.
	\item Allow users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their shopping activities.
	\item Enable full shopping cart functionality: add, update, and delete items.
	\item Support both light mode and dark mode for better user comfort.
	\item Ensure a responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.
	\item Keep the scope manageable but realistic for a fully working prototype.
\end{itemize}
